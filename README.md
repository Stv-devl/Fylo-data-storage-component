I learned to do a degraded bar.
I learned to use flexbox to center all annoying element (like img inside a square or a bar inside an other bar, tec.) and use less margin and padding.
I practiced my SASS. Use mixin for dont repeat something write in the setting page. For exemple here a flexbox to center elements.
